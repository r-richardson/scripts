# Scripts Repository

This repository contains a collection of various scripts I've created to automate tasks, parse data, manage systems, etc. These scripts are written in a variety of languages.

Any scripts I created during my time at vocational school (Berufsschule) are found in their own dedicated repository. Located at [r-richardson/school-scripts](https://github.com/r-richardson/school-scripts).
