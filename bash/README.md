# Bash Scripts Directory

This directory contains a variety of bash scripts. Bash is a Unix shell and command language, and these scripts are essentially a series of commands stored in a file that can be executed.

## How to Run a Bash Script

To run a bash script, you need to use the following syntax in your terminal:

```bash
./script_name.sh
```

You must have the proper permissions to run the script. If you encounter a permission error, you can modify the script's permissions with the following command:

```bash
chmod +x script_name.sh
```

Replace `script_name.sh` with the name of the script you want to run.

## Dependencies

Some scripts may have dependencies on certain packages. If a script has any dependencies, they will be mentioned within the respective script's .md file located in the [docs folder](https://github.com/r-richardson/scripts/tree/main/docs).
